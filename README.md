# HybridGRN
This is a robust framework for inferring Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from gene expression data. The algorithm combines two complementary approaches through adaptive model fusion and dynamic thresholding: an enhanced LASSO regression model (PoLoBag-LASSO) with local topology optimization, and the GENIE3 random forest method.
